TODO:
Critical Changes:
1. Do a clean up funtion for the model
2. The model is not responding as intented fix that
3. Extend the C++ layer and fix all the critical bugs in it 
4. Maybe use C++ for the running the model and getting response from it 

Minor changes:
1. Clean up the main.py file it looks messy right now
2. Do the mode feature
3. Try to add in some new feature or layer to it
4. Implement logger funtion 
5. Might implement core features in the Java like job scheduling , thread pools, event driven task management etc but that is for another day
6. Go with low parameter model
